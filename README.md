	This project is about investigating the functions a decentralized P2P network would perform. It's a <b>simulation</b> because the functions run locally
	in your browser. A real decentralized network would be synchronized across all clients, but in this simulation, it isn't.
	You can still check the functions, and even though it's a simulation, it would work similarly to my implementation.
